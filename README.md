# Advancing Object Detection: YOLOv4, Image Segmentation, and ConvNeXt - Reimplementation of the OneFormer model

## Features
- Enhanced OneFormer is an advanced neural network model designed for comprehensive image segmentation tasks, including semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. Building upon the original OneFormer architecture, this enhanced version integrates improvements in various components, offering more robust and accurate segmentation capabilities.
- I have used the OneFormer model from the paper "OneFormer: One Transformer to Rule Universal Image Segmentation" as a reference for re-implementations. I implemented my version of EnhancedOneFormer model from scratch and added more comments of each function.

## Prerequisites
Before installing and using Enhanced OneFormer, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- detectron2
- CUDA (if using GPU acceleration)

## Installation Instructions
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone [URL to Enhanced OneFormer repository]
  - cd EnhancedOneFormer
- Install required Python packages:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- To use Enhanced OneFormer, follow these steps:
  - Prepare Your Dataset: Ensure your dataset is in a format compatible with detectron2.

  - Configuration: Adjust the configuration file (config.yaml) to suit your specific requirements, such as model parameters, training settings, etc.

  - Training the Model:
    - python train.py --config-file config.yaml
  - Inference:
    - For performing inference with a trained model, use:
      - python infer.py --config-file config.yaml --input [path to input image] --output [path for output]
  - Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset:
      - python evaluate.py --config-file config.yaml --test-data [path to test dataset]

## Customization
- You can customize the model for your specific needs by modifying the config.yaml file or altering the model's code, especially in areas like the panoptic_inference and instance_inference methods, to fine-tune its segmentation capabilities.

## Additional Notes
- This project is an enhancement of the original OneFormer architecture and is intended for research and development purposes.
